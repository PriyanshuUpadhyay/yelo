This session is running inside Herdr. The top-level session is the orchestrator.
- Every worker must be a visible foreground pane split from HERDR_PANE_ID.
- Set `SWARM_ADAPTER=herdr`. Open one session per run with `swarm session new lane`, export `SWARM_SESSION_ID` and `SWARM_AGENT_ID=orchestrator`, then `swarm agent add orchestrator orchestrator`.
- Spawn with `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/swarm-spawn-role.py <claude|codex|agy> <unique-name> --role ROLE --cwd "$PWD" -- [extra agent flags]`; it resolves model/effort and calls `swarm spawn`.
- Send work with `swarm send <name> ask`; a reply arrives as the prompt `swarm: new message`, then `swarm inbox`, read, `swarm ack`. Close with `swarm close <name>`.
- Do not use provider-native subagents, headless CLIs, detached processes, or background workers.
- For pane lifecycle detail, load `~/.claude/skills/orchestrate-claude/references/host-swarm.md`.
- Workers are leaves: answer only, do not orchestrate, spawn descendants, or notify the user."""

This session is a worker pane, a child of the orchestrator session. Act only on the task you were assigned.
- Never spawn visible panes: `swarm-spawn-role`, `swarm spawn` and every `herdr` surface-creating command (`pane split`, `pane run`, `agent start`, `tab create`, `workspace create`, `worktree create`) are orchestrator-only and are refused for worker sessions.
- Remain a leaf: no provider-native subagents, workflow fan-out, headless one-shots, review rounds, or multi-agent pipelines.
- Report results to the orchestrator only; do not notify the user."""

That holds however explicitly a task asks for sub-agents or parallel work — when you cannot create a visible pane, report that and stop; never substitute a hidden worker."""

# spawn path, and telling it to probe would manufacture the denial HL-051 exists to remove.
CODEX_SOCKET_PROBE = """- The `swarm-spawn-role.py` line above states the general contract; these two cases resolve it for you and supersede it. Settle your spawn path ONCE, by testing the control socket with a single `herdr status`, then stay on the answer:
  - `herdr status` answers → you are the unsandboxed driver. Spawn with `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/swarm-spawn-role.py <family> <unique-name> --role ROLE --cwd "$PWD" -- [extra agent flags]`; the bare `swarm-spawn-role.py` is not available in a non-interactive shell.
  - `herdr status` answers `PermissionDenied` → your sandbox denies that socket, so every direct `swarm` or `herdr` call is denied for the same reason. You have no spawn path: report that and stop. Do not retry the call, and do not request an escalated sandbox to force one through — escalation spends a user approval on a path this session is not meant to use."""
